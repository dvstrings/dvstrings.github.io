<h3>Level 1 Backing Tracks</h3>

<p>Here is a "Melodic Stepping Stones" improvisation demonstration. This is the exercise I show you how to play in the 4th chapter of my Level 1 book. 
If you listen carefully, you'll notice that I am playing a chord tone that comes from each chord for the entire measure. I stay within an octave and I 
freely go up or down connecting each chord in a melodic line.</p>
